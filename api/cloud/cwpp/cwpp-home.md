The Prisma Cloud Workload Protection (Prisma Cloud Compute Edition) enables both automation and integration.
Use the API to set up, configure, reconfigure, and deploy Prisma Cloud Compute components.
You can also use it to extract data and integrate it with monitoring, alerting, and other systems in your environment.
