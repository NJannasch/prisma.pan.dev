:::info
The best way to add a new doc (or docs) is to develop locally. Here we'll set up you're environment and walk you through all the steps to ease you're authoring experience
:::

### Requirements

 1. **Node.js version >=14**
  
  To see if you have node installed run:
  ```bash 
  node -v
  ```
  If you don't have node, install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or use your package installer of choice (e.g. Homebrew)
2. **Yarn version >=1.5**
  
  To see if you have yarn installed run:
  ```bash
  yarn --version
  ```
  If you don't have yarn installed run:
  ```bash 
  npm install yarn --global
  ```
3. **Git Command Line**
  
  To see if you have git installed run:
  ```bash 
  git --version
  ```
  If you dont have git installed, install it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. **A Code Editor**
   
   We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you don't already have an editior of choice

#### Now that you're environment is setup, let's set up the GitHub repository
