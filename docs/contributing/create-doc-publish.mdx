Now that your doc is ready, it's time to submit it to be added to the site. There are some protections in place to make sure you can't break anything, so don't worry!
If you have any questions about the git commands, check out [Git Basics](/docs/contributing/git-basics)

1. **Make sure it builds**
  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

2. **Stage the changes**
  ```bash
  git add .
  git status
  ```
  If any files you don't want to commit are listed in the output of `git status`, check them out 
  ```bash
  git checkout file-to-remove.md
  ```

3. **Add commit message** 
  ```bash 
  git commit -m "Adding a new tutorial on blank"
  ```

4. **Push to your Github Fork**
  ```bash
  git push origin <your-branch-name>
  ```

5. **Create a pull request**
  
  - Go to `https://github.com/<your-username>/prisma.pan.dev`
  - In the top left corner under code where is says `master` select the branch you made
  - Just below that you'll see **This branch is XX commits ahead of PaloAltoNetworks:master.** Click the `Contribute` button next to it and then `Open Pull Request`
  - Open pull request from your `<your-username>/<your-feature>` to `PaloAltoNetworks/master`

6. **Check out the deploy preview**

  Now that the pull request is open, we'll automatically generate a preview of the changes and post the URL to view them within the pull request.
